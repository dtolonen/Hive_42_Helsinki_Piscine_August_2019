## Hive Helsinki / 42 Piscine August 2019


#### #workinprogress

- Bash and C: work from the 42/Hive Helsinki Piscine intensive bootcamp in August 2019 
- I am going over my exercises again, so everything here is 'work-in-process'
- the classic 'Ã‰cole 42 code copy/paste warning' applies: if you're currently on the Piscine and copy any of the code, beware! Some of the code may have been intentionally altered/disabled - and some just plain 'ol waiting to be fixed...
